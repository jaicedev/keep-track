Keep Track

Keep Track is a minimalistic journaling application that I am creating in order to get a better understanding of DOM manipulation using JavaScript.

KeepTrack is planned to have a rather large suite of features upon true completion.

Current Features :
Distraction Free Writing Environment
Save writing through automatic conversion to TXT file

Planned Features:
Text editor tools / Markdown support
Account Integration for saving entries online and holding user profile information
Authentication and encryption for account services
Site integration using AuthIo
File exportation into stylized PDF
